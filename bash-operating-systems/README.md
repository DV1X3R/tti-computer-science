# Operating Systems (Bash) (2 year / 2 semester)

I didn't like Shamshin practice book, so I picked  
[this Ryans tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/) instead.  

## Notes

```
sudo chmod +x myscript.sh   # grant execution permissions
sudo chmod 755 myscript.sh  # grant execution permissions
ls -l myscript.sh           # show permissions
./myscript.sh               # run script
apropos <keyword>           # search by keyword
man, type, whatis, whereis
```
